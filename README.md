This project aims to demonstrate the concept of rules externalization. The main idea behind rules externalization is to follow the separation of concerns principle, so that to keep the business rules of an API, application or component outside the normal execution flow.
For this we will use an AOP approach to intercept method calls, and within the rules then, we can apply validation, operations within properties, and even apply the Hollywood Principle, don't call us we'll call you, which in essence will become perpetual extensibility point for your service without hurting maintainability of the API or service.

* this is a work in progress
